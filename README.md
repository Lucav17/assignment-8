after installing devtools and then trying to install rsconnect i received an error that said "C:\Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command". I was completely unable to install rsconnect no matter what. I googled for the solution to find it being a large problem. I had to uninstall rstudio and r and then reinstall them into the 'C:' directory instead of the standard "C:/Program files" directory. After this I was able to use rsconnect and push it to the shiny.io server.
